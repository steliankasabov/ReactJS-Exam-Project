# Short Architecture Overview of "Sofia Park Theatre" ReactJS Exam Project

## Introduction
The ReactJS Exam Project is a comprehensive web application built using ReactJS. It's structured as a full-stack application with a client-side rendered frontend and a server-side backend.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

### Client
The `client` directory houses the ReactJS frontend of the application. Key components of this directory include:

- **App.jsx**: The root React component that sets up routing and global state management.
- **index.html**: The entry HTML file.
- **assets/styles**: Contains global CSS styles.
- **components**: This directory has various React components organized in subfolders. Each folder contains a `.jsx` file for the component logic and a `.module.css` file for styling.
- **contexts**: Includes React context files like `authContext.jsx` for managing global application state such as authentication.
- **hooks**: Contains custom React hooks for shared logic across components.
- **lib**: Library files, such as `request.js` for managing API requests.
- **services**: Service files that handle API interactions, like `authService.js`.
- **utils**: Utility files, including constants and helper functions.

### Server
- **server.js**: The main server file. It's likely responsible for setting up the server, defining routes, and handling requests and responses.

## Core Functionalities

### Authentication
- Implemented using `authContext.jsx` in the `contexts` directory.
- Provides login, registration, and logout functionalities.

### Play Management
- Components for managing play records are found in `components/Plays` and related subdirectories.
- `playService.js` in the `services` directory handles API requests related to plays.

### Booking and Reservations
- Components in `components/Booking` and `components/Reservations` handle booking and reservation functionalities.
- Associated services for managing bookings and reservations.

### User Interactions
- User reviews and favorites are managed through components in `components/ReviewArea` and `components/Favourites`.
- Services like `reviewService.js` and `favouriteService.js` handle corresponding API requests.

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Global state (e.g., authentication) is managed using React Context API.
- Local state is managed within individual components.

### Routing
- Handled by React Router with protected routes for authenticated users.

### API Integration
- API requests are managed through service files and the `request.js` library in the `lib` directory.

### Testing
- Component tests are present in various component directories, indicating a focus on unit and integration testing.

### Styling
- CSS Modules are used for component-level styling, providing scoped and maintainable styles.

## Working with the Project

### Setup
- Install dependencies in both `client` and `server` directories.
- Environment variables and configurations may need to be set up as per project requirements.

### Development
- Run the client and server applications in their respective directories.
- Follow established patterns for adding new components, services, or other functionalities.

### Testing
- Run predefined test scripts to ensure component and application integrity.

### Deployment
- The project can be deployed on any platform supporting Node.js for the server and a static site hosting for the client.
