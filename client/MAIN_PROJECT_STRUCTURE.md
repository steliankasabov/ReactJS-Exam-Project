# App.jsx

In the ReactJS Exam Project, the App.jsx file serves as the main component that orchestrates the routing and layout of the entire application. It is structured as follows:

* Importing Components and Libraries: It imports necessary components from react-router-dom, which are used for handling routing in the application. This includes BrowserRouter (aliased as Router), Routes, and Route.
Various components representing different pages or sections of the site are also imported. These include Home, Plays, NotFound, PlayDetails, Header, Footer, Login, Register, Booking, Logout, ProtectedRoute, Favourites, Reservations, and GuestRoute.
Additionally, it imports ToastContainer from 'react-toastify' for notifications and AuthProvider from the contexts, which likely manages authentication state.

* Defining the App Component: The App function component is defined, which returns JSX.
The returned JSX uses the Router component to wrap the entire application. This enables the use of routing throughout the app.
The AuthProvider component wraps the main content, suggesting that the app uses a context for managing authentication state.

* Setting up Routes: Inside the Router, a Routes component is used to define different route paths and their associated components.
Each Route component specifies a path and the component that should be rendered when the application navigates to that path. For example, <Route path={PATHS.HOME} element={<Home />} /> renders the Home component when the user navigates to the home path.
The application includes routes for various functionalities like viewing plays, play details, user reservations, favourites, booking, user authentication (login, register, logout), and a catch-all route for not found pages.
Some routes are wrapped in ProtectedRoute or GuestRoute components, which likely handle routing based on user authentication status.

* Layout Components: Header and Footer components are included outside but adjacent to the Routes, indicating that these components persist across different pages.
The App.jsx file is crucial as it sets up the main structure and routing logic of the application, determining what is displayed based on the current URL and managing the overall layout with persistent components like the header and footer.

# main.jsx

The main.jsx file in the ReactJS Exam Project serves as the entry point for the React application. Here's how it works and its purpose:

* Importing Necessary Libraries and Components: The file begins by importing ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client', which is essential for rendering React components to the DOM.
It imports the App component from 'App.jsx'. This is the root component that encapsulates the entire application.
Global CSS styles are imported from './assets/styles/global.css', which likely contain styles applied across the entire application.
It also imports CSS for 'react-toastify' and 'slick-carousel'. 'react-toastify' is used for notifications, and 'slick-carousel' is a library for creating carousels.

* Rendering the React Application: The file uses ReactDOM.createRoot to create a root DOM node for the React component tree. This is a part of the newer ReactDOM API for concurrent rendering in React 18 and above.
The root is created at the DOM element with the id 'root'. This is typically a div element in the 'index.html' file of the public directory.
The <App /> component is rendered inside this root element. This means that the entire React application, starting from the App component, will be mounted and managed within this DOM element.

In summary, main.jsx is crucial for initializing and rendering the React application. It sets up the root where the React component tree will be rendered and imports global styles and other necessary components. This file acts as the starting point where the React application kicks off and begins to render in the browser.

# utils

In the ReactJS Exam Project, the utils folder contains utility files that provide reusable functionalities and constants throughout the application. There are two key files in this folder:

## constants.js:

API Base URLs: It defines base URLs for API calls (API_BASE_URL and USERS_BASE_URL). These constants are likely used throughout the application to make requests to a backend server.
Path Constants: The PATHS object defines various paths used in the application, such as routes for home, plays, reservations, and more. This centralizes route management, making it easier to update paths across the app.
Application Constants: It includes constants related to the functionality of the application, such as TOTAL_ROWS, SEATS_PER_ROW, MAX_SEATS, REVIEWS_PER_PAGE, and RESERVATIONS_PER_PAGE. These constants are probably used in features like seat reservations and pagination.
API Key: It exports an API_KEY, which might be used for API requests that require authentication or identification.

## request.js:

Building Options for Fetch Requests: It contains a function buildOptions to build the options object for fetch requests. This includes setting headers for content type and authorization tokens.
Generic Request Function: The file defines a generic request function that wraps the fetch API. It handles common tasks like sending requests, parsing JSON responses, and error handling.
HTTP Method Functions: It exports partially applied versions of the request function for different HTTP methods (get, post, put, remove, patch). These make it convenient to make API requests using the respective HTTP methods throughout the application.
Overall, the utils folder and its files play a vital role in the ReactJS Exam Project by providing essential utilities and constants that streamline and unify various functionalities across the application, such as API requests, routing, and configuration of common values.

# services

The services folder in the ReactJS Exam Project contains service files that abstract the logic for communicating with various backend API endpoints. Each file in this folder is responsible for handling a specific aspect of the application. Here's a breakdown of the five files:

## authService.js:

Handles user authentication-related functionalities, including login, registration, and logout.
Functions:
login: Sends a POST request with email and password for user login.
register: Sends a POST request with username, email, and password for user registration.
logout: Sends a GET request to log the user out.

## playService.js:

Manages operations related to plays, such as retrieving, adding, editing, and deleting play records.
Functions:
getAll: Fetches all play records, sorted by creation date.
getOne: Retrieves a single play record by its ID.
deletePlay: Deletes a play record by its ID.
editPlay: Updates a play record with given data.
addPlay: Adds a new play record.
getPlayAPI: Fetches play details from an external API using IMDb ID or title.

## reviewService.js:

Handles operations related to play reviews, such as retrieving, adding, and deleting reviews.
Functions:
getPlayReviews: Fetches reviews for a specific play, with support for pagination.
addReview: Adds a new review.
deleteReview: Deletes a review by its ID.
getReviewsCount: Retrieves the count of reviews for a specific play.

## bookingService.js:

This file would handle booking-related operations, such as creating, updating, or canceling bookings. The specific functions are not provided, but it's likely to include methods to manage reservations and bookings for plays.

## userService.js:

Manages user-related operations, possibly including fetching user details, updating user profiles, or handling user preferences. As with bookingService.js, the specific functions are not detailed, but it would typically contain methods to interact with user data.

Each of these files abstracts the API calls and data handling logic related to its respective domain, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. They likely import a centralized request handling module (request.js from lib) to manage HTTP requests and utilize constants from the utils folder for URLs and other configuration details.

# lib

In the ReactJS Exam Project, the lib folder, specifically the request.js file, plays a crucial role in handling HTTP requests throughout the application. Here's how it works:

* Building Options for Fetch Requests:

The buildOptions function constructs the options object for fetch requests. It includes logic for:
Converting provided data to JSON and setting it as the request body.
Setting content-type headers for JSON.
Retrieving and including an access token from local storage in the headers for authenticated requests.
Adding a custom header if the user is an admin.

* Generic Request Function:

The request function is a generic function that wraps the browser's fetch API.
It takes three parameters: method (HTTP method), url (the endpoint URL), and data (payload for the request).
This function uses buildOptions to construct the options for the fetch request.
It handles responses, including parsing JSON and handling HTTP status codes (e.g., returning an empty object for a 204 No Content response, throwing errors for non-2xx responses).

* Exporting HTTP Method Functions:

The file exports functions for different HTTP methods (get, post, put, remove, patch).
These functions are partially applied versions of the request function, pre-filling the HTTP method. This makes it convenient to use these functions throughout the application for making specific types of HTTP requests.
In summary, request.js in the lib folder is a centralized utility for managing HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of making API calls by abstracting common tasks like setting headers, handling tokens, and processing responses. This contributes to cleaner, more maintainable code, as API-related logic is consolidated in one place instead of being scattered throughout the application.

# hooks

The hooks folder in the ReactJS Exam Project contains custom React hooks. Custom hooks are functions that let you use React state and lifecycle features in functional components. The two files in this folder, useAuth.js and useAsync.js, likely serve the following purposes:

## useAuth.js:

This custom hook is probably designed to manage authentication-related state and logic.
It could provide functionalities like logging in, logging out, checking if the user is authenticated, and possibly retrieving the current user's details.
By using this hook, components throughout the application can easily access and modify authentication state without duplicating logic.

## useAsync.js:

This hook is likely intended to simplify handling asynchronous operations, such as API calls.
It might provide a way to initiate an asynchronous request and manage its state, including loading, success, error states, and the response data.
The use of this hook would allow components to easily perform and track the status of asynchronous operations without having to manage state and side effects manually.
These custom hooks promote reusability and help to keep the component logic clean and maintainable. By encapsulating common behaviors and patterns, they allow for a more declarative approach to using these features in various components.

# contexts

In the ReactJS Exam Project, the contexts folder, specifically the authContext.jsx file, is used to manage the authentication state and logic across the application using React's Context API. Here's how it works:

* Creating the Authentication Context:

authContext.jsx starts by importing necessary modules and creating a new context for authentication using createContext() from React.
This context, AuthContext, will be used to provide and consume authentication-related data (like user login status, user information) throughout the app.

* Defining the AuthProvider Component:

The AuthProvider component is defined to wrap parts or the entire application, providing access to the AuthContext.
Inside AuthProvider, custom hooks and state management are used to handle authentication states and actions.
Functions like loginSubmitHandler, registerSubmitHandler, and logoutHandler are defined to handle user login, registration, and logout actions, respectively.
The usePersistedState hook is used to keep the authentication state (auth) synchronized with localStorage, allowing the auth state to persist across browser sessions.

* Context Values and Provider:

An object values is created, containing all the states and handler functions.
The AuthProvider component returns the AuthContext.Provider with the values object. This makes the included states and functions accessible to any child components using the useContext hook.
It also includes information like username, email, userId, authentication status (isAuthenticated), and admin status (isAdmin) derived from the auth state.

* Usage in the Application:

Other components in the application can use the useContext(AuthContext) hook to access and manipulate authentication-related data, like checking if a user is logged in, getting user details, or triggering login/logout actions.
In summary, authContext.jsx in the contexts folder is central to managing authentication across the React application. It provides a structured and efficient way to handle authentication state and logic, making it easily accessible and maintainable across different components.
